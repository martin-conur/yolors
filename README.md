## Description
YOLOrs is a CLI tool for image classification, pose estimation or (in the future) image segmentation. Uses [ultralytics](https://yolov8.com) implementation (v8) of the YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithms family. 

YOLOrs is written in Rust, using HuggingFace's Candle library. Is Fast, Light, Secure and reliable.
